                <p><strong>Course:</strong> Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</p>
                <p><strong>Course Code:</strong> 24ECSC205</p>
                <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Prof. Prakash Hegade</p>

            <h2>📖 About the Course</h2>
            <p>
                Design and analysis of algorithms is more than a branch of computer science – it is the core of
                computing and is deeply connected to science, business, and technology. The course builds analytical
                thinking, helps identify interesting patterns in nature and systems, and teaches us how computational
                thinking can simplify complex problems.
            </p>

            <h3>💡 Data Structures & Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
                Exploring data structures feels like walking through a family of powerful ideas. Arrays and strings
                show continuity in memory, linked lists resemble chains of connected web pages, stacks and queues model
                biscuits in a tin and people in queues, while trees and tries represent hierarchies and fast lookup.
                Randomness in skip lists and optimality in graph algorithms give us new ways of understanding systems.
            </p>

            <h3>🌐 Algorithms in Daily Life</h3>
            <p>
                Algorithms are everywhere around us like air – present, yet often invisible. Dijkstra's algorithm silently
                powers GPS navigation, sorting algorithms organize huge e-commerce catalogues, and graph algorithms
                optimize networks, logistics, and infrastructure. They take complex situations and carve them into
                beautiful, efficient solutions that improve our digital and physical experiences.

            <div class="project-intro">
                <p>
                    City design is a complex and multi-dimensional challenge that demands careful planning,
                    optimization, and sustainability. The <span class="highlight">City Design Project – Rajdwar</span>
                    uses algorithmic thinking and DAA concepts to plan roads, services, business zones, and public
                    utilities for a smart, balanced city.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We model the city as a graph, where intersections and key structures become nodes and roads become edges.
                Using shortest path algorithms, greedy strategies, and optimization techniques, we look at how travel
                time, connectivity, and access to essential services can be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project focuses on:
            </p>
            <ul class="contribution-list">
                <li>Minimizing travel distance and congestion using graph algorithms.</li>
                <li>Planning public transport, residential areas, and business clusters more intelligently.</li>
                <li>Ensuring quick access to hospitals, education, and emergency services.</li>
                <li>Aligning growth with sustainability and SDG-11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.</li>

                Rajdwar is designed and analysed by a four-member team. Each member focused on a different part of the
                city and mapped their ideas to SDGs and algorithmic thinking.
