                <p><strong>Course:</strong> Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</p>
                <p><strong>Course Code:</strong> 24ECSC205</p>

            <h2>📖 What is the Course About?</h2>
            <p>
                Design and analysis of algorithms is more than a branch of computer science. It is the core of
                computer science, and, in all fairness, can be said to be relevant to most of science, business, 
                and technology. The course is about understanding the interesting patterns existing in nature as 
                many natural processes can inspire computational algorithms and vice versa. It helps in development 
                of analytical thinking which can help in various problem solving strategies.

            <h3>💡 Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
                Exploring data structures feels like a journey through a fascinating family. From the continuity 
                of memory blocks in arrays and strings to the interlinked nature of web pages seen in linked lists, 
                each structure tells a story. Stacks and queues evoke everyday images of biscuit piles and waiting 
                lines, while trees and tries expand our understanding into hierarchies and efficient searches. Skip 
                lists, inspired by coin tosses, add an element of randomness with precision.
            </p>

            <h3>🌐 Real-Time Applications</h3>
            <p>
                We are both aware and oblivious to the algorithms that permeate our lives, much like the omnipresent 
                air we breathe. Dijkstra's Algorithm guides us home through GPS, ensuring the quickest route, while 
                sorting algorithms manage massive datasets in e-commerce platforms. These algorithms take complex 
                challenges and carve them into elegant solutions, quietly enhancing our daily technological 
                interactions and making our digital experiences smoother and more intuitive. They are the invisible 
                hands that optimize, protect, and personalize the technology we rely on every day.

        <!-- Project Overview -->

            <div class="project-intro">
                <p>
                    City design is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires careful planning and optimization. 
                    The <span class="highlight">City Design Project - Rajdwar</span> aims to explore various algorithmic 
                    approaches to solve urban planning problems such as optimal road network design, facility placement, 
                    traffic flow optimization, and resource allocation.

            <p>
                In this project, we utilize <span class="highlight">Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</span> 
                techniques to address real-world city planning scenarios. Our approach involves implementing graph 
                algorithms, dynamic programming solutions, greedy algorithms, and optimization techniques to create 
                efficient and sustainable city layouts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The project focuses on practical applications such as minimizing travel distances, optimizing public 
                transportation routes, ensuring efficient emergency response systems, and planning green spaces. 
                Through computational analysis and algorithmic thinking, we aim to demonstrate how computer science 
                can contribute to better urban environments and smarter cities for the future.
