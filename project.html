                <h2>🌍 Problem Context</h2>
                <p>
                    Rajdwar represents a growing urban region that must balance economic development, liveability,
                    sustainability, and accessibility. Every design decision — where to place hospitals, markets,
                    industries, roads, and transport hubs — affects travel time, pollution, safety, and quality of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than treating this as just “drawing a map”, we treat it as a <strong>computational problem</strong>.
                    Nodes, edges, weights, constraints, and objectives together define an algorithmic view of the city.
                </p>

                <h3>🎯 Design Goals</h3>
                <ul class="contribution-list">
                    <li>Minimize average travel time between key locations.</li>
                    <li>Ensure every residential cluster has access to health, education, and markets within a bounded radius.</li>
                    <li>Optimize placement of high-impact structures like factories, hospitals, IT parks, and public transport.</li>
                    <li>Align the design with SDG-11 and related SDGs for sustainable, inclusive urban development.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>🧠 DAA Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                    Our city layout uses several core ideas from design and analysis of algorithms:
                </p>
                <ul class="contribution-list">
                    <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> Intersections, zones, and key structures are nodes; roads and paths are edges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm:</strong> Used conceptually for shortest-path travel between important locations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Greedy Choices:</strong> Selecting locations for critical services (like hospitals) to cover maximum population first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clustering / Partitioning:</strong> Dividing the city into sectors (east, west, industrial, commercial, etc.) assigned to each team member.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity Thinking:</strong> Understanding trade-offs between rich connectivity (more edges) and cost / congestion.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                The following layout visualizes our conceptual design of Rajdwar. Each region reflects
                algorithmic decisions about connectivity, accessibility, and sustainability, combining
                industrial zones, commercial hubs, residential areas, and public services.

        <!-- Team Responsibilities -->

            <h2>🧩 Team-wise Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>Each team member focused on a different perspective of Rajdwar:</p>

            <ul class="contribution-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Kushvendra Singh</strong> – Modelled factories, warehouses, power stations, metro/public transport,
                    housing, parking, retail, logistics, and water bodies, and mapped them to relevant SDG 11 targets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Manthan Rayakar</strong> – Analysed commercial, health, recreational, and community infrastructure
                    such as malls, theatres, hotels, hospitals, community centres, ATMs, pharmacies, and grocery stores.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pranav Chougule</strong> – Proposed sustainable business ideas around the east sector, including
                    co-working hubs, wellness centres, EV charging, repair ecosystems, and education-focused ventures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ayush Kumar Ojha</strong> – Focused on business structures such as IT sector, hotel/bar/post office
                    management, petrol pumps, markets, schools, and hospitals, and analysed their SDG 11 impact.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These perspectives together make Rajdwar not just a diagram, but a structured, SDG-aligned, algorithmically
                reasoned <strong>city model</strong>.
